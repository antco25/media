	"content": "In 2015, I got my B.ASc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toronto and am currently employed as a full-time HVAC Design Engineer.\n\nSince my university days, I have always been dabbling into programming in my spare time. I have done work on embedded systems, mobile apps and even game development. Eventually, I tried web development, realized that I enjoyed making websites and have focused all of my efforts into it ever since.\n\nIn 2022, I made the decision that I would pursue a change from what was a hobby into a full-time career. I am passionate, hard-working, eager to learn and believe I can provide valuable contribution to any team.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me below. I am currently open to and would love to discuss any opportunities."
